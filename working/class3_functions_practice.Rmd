```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# call in the functions I made: 
source("R/auto_power.R")

```

Computing the power of a truck with the surface area of 16 m^2 and a mass of 31,572 kg at different speeds:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# converting units from km/hr to m/s
speeds <- mps_conversion(c(80, 120, 40, 5))

speeds <- append(speeds, 30) # adding the value that was already in the right units
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

truck_power <- auto_power(mass = 31752, 
           velocity = speeds, 
           area = 16)

truck_power
```
