In this assignment, we created a function that takes a vector of fish names and  returns three items: the most common fish, the rarest fish, and the total number of fish. We will then use this function with data provided. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
# read in the data

possible_fish <- read.delim(here("ESM_262_Examples", "Data", "fish.txt"))
head(possible_fish)
```

```{r}
# source my function

source("../R/compute_fish.R")
```

```{r}
# input fish data into function

compute_fish(possible_fish)
```
